# Age-and-Gender-Detection-
This project focuses on predicting the age and gender of individuals using deep learning techniques. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the UTKFace dataset, a large-scale face dataset with annotations of age, gender.
# UTKFace Dataset
The UTKFace dataset is a rich resource for face-related tasks, providing the following attributes for over 20,000 face images:

Age: Spanning from 0 to 116 years old.
Gender: Categorized as Male or Female.
Ethnicity: Detailed information about the ethnic background.
